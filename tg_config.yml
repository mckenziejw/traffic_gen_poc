# This file defines the traffic to be generated by the traffic generator tools
# This includes:
# 1. Clients and Server to be deployed
# 2. Actions to be performed by the traffic generator containers
# 3. Details and metadata for those actions

# inventory defines the clients to be used
# These will be used to create both the docker-compose file and referenced by the traffic generator middleware
# While building scenarios
